To enable the correct alignment of an automatically misaligned fiducial frame, 

I generated functions in R saving the corrected data: 

A) Tissue Positions

B) Matrix Files

in a wp/sample_corr/ folder, with 

wp = data directory, to be specified, and 

sample = sample name to be specified.

C) enables to check the counts per spot before and after correction.
